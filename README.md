Illustrations of antibodies created using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com).

I recommend opening the file in Excalidraw. To do this:

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to https://excalidraw.com
3. From the dropdown menu select "Open" and choose the `.excalidraw` file you would like to edit
4. From there, one can export the file as an SVG/PNG as well as edit the sketch
